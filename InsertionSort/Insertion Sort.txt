                            Insertion Sort

1.  Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left portion
    which is aways sorted
    We are taking an element and inserting it in the correct spot
    [3,38,5,47,41]
    [3,38,5,47,41]
    [3,5,38,47,41]
    [3,5,38,47,41]
    [3,5,38,41,47]

1.  Start by picking the second element in the array
2.  Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary
3.  Continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order,
    iterate through the sorted potion(left side) to place the element in the correct place
4.  Repeat until sorted and return arr

#Time complexity: 
1.the worst case is quadratic O(nÂ²)
