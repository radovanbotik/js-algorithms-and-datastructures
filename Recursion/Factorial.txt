                         Writing Factorial Recursively

#Ex: 4!

const factorial = num => {
  if (num === 1) {
    return num;
  }
  return factorial(num - 1) * num;
};

console.log(factorial(4));

4! = 4*3*2*1

1.  We want to multiply current number by number below it so what we want is
    num * function(num-1)
    We want to call the function again and automatically get the number
    that is 1 below the current number
    However we need a base case otherwise we will get stuck in infinite loop,
    if num===1 we wnt to return num;
