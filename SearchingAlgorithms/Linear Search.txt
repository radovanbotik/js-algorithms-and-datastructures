                                Linear search

1.  The simplest way to search for a value is to look at every element
    in the array and check if the value we are currently looking at
    matches the value we want.
2.  Javascript offers methods that can be used to search:
    1.  indexOf
    2.  includes
    3.  find
    4.  findIndex

Linear Search using for loop:
const pseudo = (arr, num) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === num) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
};
console.log(pseudo([1, 3, 5, 7, 8], 5));

Big O:
1.  Best case is O(1), the first match
3.  Average is O(n)
2.  Worst case is O(n)
