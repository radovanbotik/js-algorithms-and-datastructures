                            Naive string search
1.  The main idea is to lookahaed
2.  We set up counter, outter and inner loop
    2.1 First iteration of j
    str1[0+0] !== str2[0]
    str1[0+1] !== str2[1]
    str1[0+2] !== str2[2]
    2.2 If the characters dont match we break out of inner loop and increase
        the value of outter loop
    2.3 If they match we check whether the value of j in its last iteration is
        the value of last character of the second string
        if 4 === 4
        If it does we increase our count by 1
3.  We return our count
