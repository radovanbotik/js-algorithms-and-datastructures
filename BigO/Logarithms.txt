                                        Recap

1. logarithm is the inverse of exponential 
    # opposite of growing
    logarithm and exponential func is a pair just like
    multiplication and division

    log₂(8) = 3            -------> 2³ = 8
    log₂(value) = exponent -------> 2exponent = value

    we can omit log₂ so we will say just log

2. The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times
    you can divide that number by 2 before you get value that is
    less than or equal to one.

    8 / 2 = 4 // still bigger than 1
    4 / 2 = 2 // still bigger than 1
    2 / 2 = 1 // it is 1, we divided the base by 2 three times so log is 3 

3. O(log n) is good compared to O(n) or O(nlog n)
