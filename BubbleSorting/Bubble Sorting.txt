                                Bubble Sort

It is a sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top

1.  We set up inner and outter loop
2.  Inside inner loop we check if previous value for current iteration of j
    is larger than value of j in the next iteration.
    If it is we swap the values.
    
    if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        let temp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = temp;
      }

Optimization:

1.  We are basicly checking if we made any swaps the last we looped through array 
2.  We make a variable no swaps and if its true that means there are no swaps
    and we are going to break out of the loop.
3.  In the outter loop we set noSwap to true however in the inner loop
    if we make swap we can set it to false
4.  We are reducing the number of total iterations.

#Big O:

1.Time complexity is generally O(n²)
If the data is nearly sorted it might be more efficient however the worst
case scenario is O(n²)
