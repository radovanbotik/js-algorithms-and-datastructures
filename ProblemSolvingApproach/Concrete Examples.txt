                            Concrete Examples:

1.  Examples can help you understand the problem better
2.  Examples also provide sanity checks so that if you eventually have
    solution you can tell it works how it should.

#   Start with simple Examples
    write inputs and outputs
#   Progress to more complex examples
#   Explore examples with empty inputs
#   Explore examples with invalid inputs

#Ex:

Write a function which takes in a string
and returns counts of each character in the string.

1.  Create example :
    charCount('aaa');  /// {a:3}
    charCount('hello); /// {h:1, e:1, l:2 , o:1}

2.  Progress to mroe complex examples:
    charCount('my number is 199293')
        #more questions: should we count spaces? numbers?
    charCount('Hello hi')
        #more questions: Casing? Should we account for uppercase?

3.  Explore examples with empty inputs
    charCounts()
    charCounts('')
        # what then?

    It is good to think about these edge cases.
