                          Understand The Problem:

1.  Can you restate the problem in your own words?

2.  What are the inputs that go into the problem

3.  What are the outputs that should come from the solution

4.  Can be outputs be determined from the inputs?
    In other words do I have enough information to solve the problem?

5.  How should I label the important pieces od fata that are a part of the problem?


#Ex:
#Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum:

1.  Can you restate the problem in your own words?

#   Implement additiom

2.  What are the inputs that go into the problem

#   It should be numbers, but how big number is? wouldnt it be better to use
#   string instead? Our function accepts just 2 numbers but could we pass in more?
#   If is it a number should it be decimal or integer?

3.  What are the outputs that should come from the solution

#   Should it be int? float? string?

4.  Can be outputs be determined from the inputs?
    In other words do I have enough information to solve the problem?

#   What happens if I receive only 1 input? should i return undefined, null or set
#   set default value?

5.  How should I label the important pieces od fata that are a part of the problem?
#   What terminology should I use?
