                        Break it down:

1.  Takes the steps to the problem and write them down.
    This forces you to think about the code before you write it.
    It also helps to catch any lingering issues or misunderstandings

#Ex:

Write a function which takes in a string
and returns counts of each character in the string.

(say it loud)
Steps:

1.  We create a skeleton to our function
    function charCount(){}

2.  We know it accepts a string 
    function charCount(string){}

  
3.  function charCount(string){
    //do something
    }

4.  Our interviewer decided we dont need to differentiate between
    uppercase and lowercase and we should include numbers

5.  
    #Make object to return at end
    #We need to take an action for each character in our string, loop through it.
    #Return object at end

    #We have object lets loop:
    
    1.Lets take the first char as example: we should lowercase it
        1.1 we lowercase each char
        1.2 we lowercase whole string at begining

    2.Lets have a look at our object:
        2.1  if it contains char we should increase the count by 1
        2.2  if it doesnt contain the char we should simply add it
             and set its count to 1
    
     function charCount(string){
        //make object to return at end
        //loop over string
            //if the char is number/letter AND a key in obj add 1 to the count
            //if the char is number/letter AND not a key add it and set the count
            //if the char is something else dont do anything
        //return object
    }
