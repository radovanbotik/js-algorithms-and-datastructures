                            Solve or Simplify

1.  Solve the problem if you can or if you cant solve a SIMPLER problem

#Simplify:
    1.  Find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do
    2.  Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    3.  Write a simplified solution
    4.  Then incorporate that difficulty back in

#Ex:

    function charCount(string){
        //make object to return at end
        //loop over string
            //if the char is number/letter AND a key in obj add 1 to the count
            //if the char is number/letter AND not a key add it and set the count
            //if the char is something else dont do anything
        //return object
    }
