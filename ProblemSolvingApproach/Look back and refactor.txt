                                Look Back And Refactor

#Refactoring questions:
    
    1.Can you check the result?
    2.Can you derive the result differently?
    3.Can you understand it at a glance?
    4.Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
    5.Can you improve the performance of your solution?
    6.Can you think of other ways to refactor?
    7.How have other people solved this problem?

1.Improving our charCount Example:
    1.1 we could use for of instead of simple for loop
    1.2 we could simplify if logic
    1.3 we could swap regex since it might not be that performant
        we could use separate function that checks for charcodes

const isAlphaNumeric = character => {
  const code = character.charCodeAt(0);
  if (
    !(code > 47 && code < 58) && // numeric 0-9
    !(code > 64 && code < 91) && // upper alpha A-Z
    !(code > 96 && code < 123) // lower alpha a-z
  ) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
};

const charCount3 = string => {
  const result = {};
  //swapping for loop with for of loop
  for (character of string) {
    character = character.toLowerCase();
    if (isAlphaNumeric(character)) {
      //if its truthy increase by 1 otherwise set to 1
      result[character] = ++result[character] || 1;
    }
  }
  return result;
};

console.log(charCount3("hello!"));
