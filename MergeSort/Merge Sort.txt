                                    Merge Sort
It is combination of splitting mergin and sorting
It is exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 elements are always sorted
    -   Empty array or array of number is always sorted. [],[9] it is sorted.
It works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements,
then building up a newly sorted array.
                            [8,3,5,4,7,6,1,2]
                        split in 2 we get 2 arrays
                        [8,3,5,4]           [7,6,1,2]
                    they are still too big so we split again
                    [8,3]   [5,4]          [7,6]    [1,2]
                            still not small enough
                  [8]  [3]  [5]  [4]      [7]   [6]  [1]  [2]
        Now we merge them together because now each array is sorted
        We compare neighboring arrays, and merge them in the order
                    [3,8]   [4,5]           [6,7]   [1,2]
        Now that each array is sorted we we will merge it width
        neigboring array again. We will compare inputs and merge them
        in the order
                        [3,4,5,8]          [1,2,6,7]
                        And we repeat the process again
                                [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
